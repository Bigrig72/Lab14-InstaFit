# Lab14-InstaFit
.Net project replicating instagram- with razor

## Introduction to the app
This app will be a small demo of what the current app instagram has, but all fitness related. It will demonstrate
the ability to have a personal news feed of images, descriptions and location inforamtion. You
will have the ability to add a new post, edit an existing post and view details of a post. This app is formulated 
for the fitness population in mind. 

## How to use
When landing to the app you will see your news feed of your specific posts. From that page you will be
able to add a new post or edit a past post. When you want to add a post, the page will be redirected to a new page
that will show a new template of a card to create and add to the news feed. If you choose to edit, you will be directed to 
a templated page that will allow you to edit the current post and re-post it back to the feed.
